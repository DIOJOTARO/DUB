# DUB
Can we we keep keep each other company
Maybe we can be be each others company
Oh company
Let's set each others lonely nights
Be each others paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change
You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
